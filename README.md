## Installation

1. Clone this repository
```
$   git clone "https://github.com/jcgonzalezb/user_registration_web_app.git"
```

2. Access the 'user_registration_web_app' directory:

```
$   cd user_registration_web_app
```

3. As a good practice, I suggest you create a virtual environment, e.g.

```
$   python3 -m venv myenv
```

4. Activate the new environment

```
$   source myenv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the requirements
```
$   pip install -r requirements.txt
```


6. Run the program

```
$   python3 app.py
```

Now you are running the web application and it is ready to create requests locally and test functionality, e.g.

```
 * Serving Flask app 'config' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 262-635-844
```

7. To test the web application, copy the IP address from your console, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000 and go to the Usage in this README file.

8. When you have done, terminate the app process with Ctrl+c and deactivate the venv.

```
$ deactivate
```
## Usage

When you start the web application and copy the IP address from your console, the home page is shown. There you will see a welcome message and to links to two different endpoints.

#### Example of use

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. There you will see a welcome message and to links to two different endpoints. The first endpoint is create a new user (Crear nuevo usuario). The second one is list of users created (Lista de usuarios creados). For this particular example, we are creating a new user and then we are going to check the list of users created.

2. Make click on the create a new user (Crear nuevo usuario) link. A form will be shown and you can fill it with the name, email and city of the user. Once the form complete, make click on create user (Crear usario)buttom. If the information is correct, you will see a form confirming that the user was created successfully. From there you have to continue to the home page.

![new user_3](documentation/images/new_user3.png)


If the form is not complete or the name or the email are already created, the web application will show you warnings and will let you know what should be done. You cannot proceed further until the form has been created correctly. If you do not want to continue, just click on the go to the home page (Ir a la pagina principal) link.

3. The next step is checking the list of users, which in this case will be the user previously created. On the home page, make click on the list of users created (Lista de usuarios creados) link. The web application will show you the list of users created.
